Configure the print-url of a mapfish-print service in the web.xml
of the application.

You can find an example request under examples/irix-test.json that
should illustrate the structure of the request.

This request should be posted to the IRIXClient servlet.

E.g.:

    curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data \
        @examples/irix-test.json http://localhost:8080/irix-client/IRIXClient
