Configure the print-url of a mapfish-print service in the web.xml
of the application.

You can find an example request under examples/irix-test.json that
should illustrate the structure of the request.

This request should be posted to the IRIXClient servlet.

E.g.:

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -X POST --data \
        @examples/irix-test.json http://localhost:8080/irix-client/IRIXClient

    or only for images (png, jpg, svg, pdf) see examples/img-test.json

    curl -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" -X POST --data \
            @examples/img-test.json http://localhost:8080/irix-client/IRIXClient

The WSDL URL of the irix-webservice needs to be configured in the pom.xml

=======

web.xml Configuration params

<param-name>user-header</param-name>
If this param is configured, irix-client uses the Header set in param-value as the users id. This value overrides DokpoolDocumentOwner in DokpoolMeta while processing IRIX.!

<param-name>roles-header</param-name>
If this param is configured, irix-client uses the Header set in param-value as the users roles. the roles are used to check for permissions.

<param-name>user-displayname-header</param-name>
If this param is configured, irix-client uses the Header set in param-value as the users displayname. This value overrides User in irix to set PersonContactInfo in while processing IRIX.!

<param-name>roles-permission</param-name>
If this param is configured, irix-client uses the roles set in param-value to check if the user is allowed to use this service by comparing it with the roles in roles-header. This configuration only makes sense, if roles-header is set as well.
